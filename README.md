- 👋 Hi, I’m @gkalakutskiy and I'm 19 y.o.
- 👀 I’m interested in Social Sciences and that's why I am going to study Social and Cultural Anthropology in September.
- 🌱 Although my field of interests is located in Humanities, I’m currently learning Data Analytics (with Google on Coursera). I want to acquire such a technical skill to have broader opportunities in Urban Studies and Social Sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to working with Data Analysis. I'd love to help anywhere I can to make data-driven decisions.
